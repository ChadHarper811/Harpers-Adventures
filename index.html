            <h2>Travel Story:</h2>
            <p>Back in 2009, right after my high school graduation, my best friends Sen and Young were going to visit their 
               family in Taiwan. I had never been outside the country at this point and I half-jokingly asked them to convince 
               their parents to let me tag along. When they actually did ask and their parents said yes I was surprised and 
               thrilled. I had to pay for all my own travel expenses and such but they would let me stay with them and feed me 
               when we ate at their house. We were there for about 30 days and we also went to Tokyo, Japan for 5 days. These 
               are the better pictures below and a short journal entry for each day's activities.
